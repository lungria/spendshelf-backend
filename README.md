# spendshelf-backend

## Overview

Spendshelf started as a desire to keep money spending in the personal or/and family budget under control.

 
All incoming transactions are being sent to categories - and each category has a monthly budget (spent money limit). At the end of the budget period (usually at the end of the months or near to salary date) - you either close to monthly budget per each category (which is good) - or not (which is bad). 

## Current status (v1 vs v2)

We have working v1 in `master` branch, that is not being activelly maintained.
We also have `v2/master` branch, that is complete rewrite, based on different principles and using 
PostgtreSQL as main storage.

## Contributors guide

Any contribution is welcome through pull requests

## Frontend

For `v2` we do not have any UI client at the moment. 
We would implement swift-UI native app for iOS eventually.
